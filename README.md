# My Dogs Project

A serverless application for managing dog profiles and image uploads built with AWS SAM (Serverless Application Model). This project consists of a backend service that provides REST APIs for dog management and automated image processing capabilities.

## Overview

The My Dogs project is a modern serverless application that allows users to:
- Create and manage dog profiles
- Upload images for their dogs with automated processing
- Retrieve dog information with associated images

The application is built using AWS serverless technologies including Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for pet management.

## Architecture

![High Level Diagram](dogs-service/docs/image_uploader.drawio.png)

The architecture consists of:
- **Frontend Client**: Web/mobile application for user interactions
- **API Gateway**: RESTful API endpoints for dog and image management
- **Lambda Functions**: Serverless compute for business logic and image processing
- **DynamoDB**: NoSQL database for storing dog profiles and metadata
- **S3**: Object storage for dog images with event-driven processing

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- AWS CLI configured with appropriate permissions
- AWS SAM CLI installed
- Python 3.13
- Docker (for local development)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-dogs
   ```

2. **Deploy the backend service**
   ```bash
   cd dogs-service
   sam build
   sam deploy --guided
   ```

3. **Test the deployment**
   ```bash
   # Get the API endpoint from SAM outputs
   export API_BASE_URL="https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/Prod"
   
   # Health check
   curl -X GET "$API_BASE_URL/health"
   ```
